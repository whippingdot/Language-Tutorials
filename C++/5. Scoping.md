# Scoping

## Start

Scoping is used for plenty of reasons, such as allowing reusing variables names, making code easier to reason about, reducing the accessibility of data, among other reasons. There are plenty of different ways that scopes can be classified, and plenty of reasons to use scoping. Scoping affects variable visibility, this entails quite a lot, while being such a simple idea. As a general rule, scopes are created by curly brackets (`{}`).

### Code

```cpp
int main()
{
  { // A new scope
    char a = 'a';

    std::cout << a << std::endl;
  }
}
```

### Output

```shell
a
```

## Scopes

The main function itself has curly brackets as part of its declaration syntax, and all variables declared within it are scoped to the function itself. This means that the variables declared in a function's scope/function can only be used inside that function. You **cannot** call a variable outside of the function it was created in.

### Code

```cpp
int main()
{
    { // place arbitrary curly brackets to create a new scope
        char a = 'a';

        std::cout << a << std::endl;
    }

    std::cout << a << std::endl; // This will create the error below
}
```

### Output

```shell
error: use of undeclared identifier 'a'
```

## Moving the value from one scope to another

If you want to access a variable created in a separate scope you can move the value stored in that variable into another variable in the scope you wanted the value to be in. <!--This is kinda confusing and I would be happy if someone changed this-->

### Code

```cpp
int main()
{
    char outer_scope = 'a';

    {
        char inner_scope = 'b';

        outer_scope = inner_scope;
    }

    std::cout << outer_scope << std::endl;
}
```

### Output

```shell
b
```

When getting involved with more complicated use cases, other things will come into consideration, which will be covered later.
