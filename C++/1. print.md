# Print

## Start

Printing is like outputting to the console. You make something appear in the console. In C++ you do that a little differently. You don't type `print` as you do in Python. In the [previous](0.%20Setup.md) file, I had talked about `std::cout` and `std::cin` which is what we use for printing and taking inputs. First - `std::cout`. This is followed by `<<` and then the [variable](2.%20Variables.md) / text.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  // Almost all the lines in C++ end with a semicolon ';'
  std::cout << "Hoi" << " there" << std::endl;
}
```

### Output

```shell
Hoi there
```

Go to the bottom to see what `std::endl` is. The reason we used it here is that then the next line in the command line you are using will be started on a new line and not right after the text is outputted.

## `std::cin`

`std::cin` is used for taking inputs. You can take the input and store it in a variable for use later. `std::cin` is followed by `>>` and then the variable name.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  // You will learn variables next so bear with me or skip to the next file to understand this
  std::string var = "";

  std::cout << "Give me a number please: ";
  std::cin >> var;

  std::cout << "Your variable is: " << var << std::endl;
}
```

### Output

```shell
Give me a number please: # Input is taken here. Also, this is a comment in the shell
Your variable is: # Inputted thing is outputted here
```

**Note: To end and start a new line you use `\n` in a string (meaning double or single quotes) or you use `<< std::endl` at the end of the `std::cout` statement like we did. Automatically a new line is started after a `std::cin`, meaning the next `std::cout` statement following the `std::cin` is automatically printed on the next line.**
