# Advanced Operators

## Start

In this file I am going to teach you about more advanced operators. There are three more types we are going to learn about - Compound-assignment operators, relational operators, and logical operators.

## Coumpound-assignment Operators

The Coumpound-assignment operators are basically shortcuts for performing an operation upon itself and another value, assigning back into itself:

- `+=`
- `-=`
- `*=`
- `/=`
- `%=`

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int three = 3;
  int four = 4;

  int answerUsed = 0;
  std::cout << "The original variable is: " << answerUsed << std::endl;

  answerUsed += four;
  // equivalent to: { answerUsed = answerUsed + four }
  std::cout << "The variable + 4 = " << answerUsed << std::endl;

  answerUsed -= three;
  std::cout << "The newly added variable - 3 = " << answerUsed << std::endl;

  answerUsed *= four;
  std::cout << "The newly subtracted variable * 4 = " << answerUsed << std::endl;

  answerUsed /= three;
  std::cout << "The newly multiplied variable / 3 = " << answerUsed << std::endl;

  answerUsed += 4;
  answerUsed %= four;
  std::cout << "The newly divided variable (and 4 added for demonstration purposes) % 4 = " << answerUsed << std::endl;
}
```

### Output

```shell
The original variable is: 0
The variable + 4 = 4
The newly added variable - 3 = 1
The newly subtracted variable * 4 = 4
The newly multiplied variable / 3 = 1
The newly divided variable (and 4 added for demonstration purposes) % 4 = 1
```

## Relational Operators

Relational Operators are operators which compare things together:

- `<`
- `>`
- `<=`
- `>=`
- `==`
- `!=`

`<` means "less than" \
`>` means "greater than" \
`<=` means "less than or equal to" \
`>=` means "greater than or equal to" \
`==` means "equal to" \
`!=` means "not equal to"

All of the above operators compare two values against each other. For example, `x == y` checks if `x` and `y` are equal.

**Note: At the lowest level, computers represent booleans as an integer, '0' or '1' (for "false" and "true" respectively), and normally C++'s `std::cout <<` will quite literally show `0` or `1`. We can change this behavior by manipulating `std::cout`, by using `std::boolalpha`, which will now show `true` or `false`, instead of `1` or `0`. (`std::cout` is a `std::ostream`; streams will be covered much later)**

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  bool less = 4 < 3;
  bool greater = 4 > 3;
  bool less_or_equal = 4 <= 3;
  bool greater_or_equal = 4 >= 3;
  bool equal = 4 == 3;
  bool not_equal = 4 != 3;

  std::cout << std::boolalpha;

  std::cout << less << std::endl
            << greater << std::endl
            << less_or_equal << std::endl
            << greater_or_equal << std::endl
            << equal << std::endl
            << not_equal << std::endl;
}
```

### Output

```shell
false
true
false
true
false
true
```

## Logical Operators

Logical Operators are the operators which are used when combining multiple boolean expressions together. For example, when you want to check if `4 < 3` _and_ `5 < 3` are true at the same time, you use these:

- `&&`
- `||`
- `!`

`&&` means "and" \
`||` means "or" \
`!` means "not"

The above operators are used with two Relational Operator statements or with two of other things. Like if you have `4 > 5 || 4 != 5` the result will be `true` because at least one of the two statements are true (`4 != 5`) and we said `||` so only one of them have to be true. `&&` means both / all of them have to be true and `!` means the result is reversed (`true` => `false` and `false` => `true`).

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  bool boolean1 = 4 < 3 && 5 > 3;
  bool boolean2 = 4 < 3 || 5 > 3;
  bool boolean3 = !(4 < 3);

  std::cout << std::boolalpha
            << boolean1 << std::endl
            << boolean2 << std::endl
            << boolean3 << std::endl;
}
```

### Output

```shell
false
true
true
```

**Note: These types of operators are generally not used like this, and are instead often used in a while loop, a for loop, an if statement, or in a conditional operator (all of which will be covered later).**
