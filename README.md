# Intro

These are tutorials in languages made in the **english** language ~~luckily~~. The coding languages taught currently are Python, C++, and Ruby. Markdown doesn't count as a coding language but we are teaching it too.

## Courses

C++ - @whippingdot, & helped by @programmeruser2 & @CrimsonCodes0 \
Python - @whippingdot, & helped by @BD103 & @Rayyan06 / @Plorzon \
Markdown - @whippingdot \
Ruby - @darkdarcool \
Cookeylang - @cursorweb & @darkdarcool \
HTML - @MrIntellectual \

## Prerequisite / Replit

I won't teach you how to download the editor, or anything like that. I won't tell you how to download Python, or a C++ compiler, I will only teach you the language's syntax(meaning how to write the code). Because of this, I recommend you use replit to practice coding.

## Contributions

You can contribute easily by cloning & editing this repo in your favorite editor (mine is VS Code). Then create a pull request, and I will check it out and see if I should add your changes. If you want to create a new file, think of where it would fit, and add a number before the file name to make it come where you want it to in alphabetical order. After that change the rest of the files with and greater than the number your file has. Change their numbers by adding 1. If you are too lazy or don't understand this, I will do it myself, but please make it easier for me.

## Practice Problems

I don't have time right now to make these, so I won't give you them for now. I will add these later if I have the motivation and time.
