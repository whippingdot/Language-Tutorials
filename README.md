# Intro

These are tutorials I made, which teach you some coding languages, and other similar things like Markdown, CSS, HTML, DSMD, etc. These tutorials are written in **English** for now, but in the future, we may add support for other languages - such as Chinese (but this is unlikely).

## Courses

C++ - @whippingdot, & helped by @programmeruser2 & @CrimsonCodes0 \
Python - @whippingdot, @kokonut27, & helped by @BD103 & @Rayyan06 / @Plorzon \
Markdown - @whippingdot \
Ruby - @darkdarcool \
Cookeylang - @cursorweb & @darkdarcool \
HTML - @MrIntellectual \
DSMD - @darkdarcool

## Prerequisite / Replit

You will have to know how to download the languages and set them up. Sometimes this might be confusing or hard to do, so I recommend using replit.com - in which you don't need to download anything and don't need to set up anything to get started. Just start typing!

Sign up to replit [here](https://replit.com/signup) and create a new repl after signing up [here](https://replit.com/new)!

## Contributions

You can contribute easily by cloning & editing this repo in your favorite editor. After that, make your changes and create a pull request. I will check it out and give you some feedback/improvements. After everything is perfect, I will merge and I will add you in the courses area^. While making the changes, try keeping the format that is used in the other files, and if you are creating a new tutorial, try also creating the file names with the same format as most other file names!

^ If the courses area gets too filled, I will create a new section for contributions

## Practice Problems

For now, we will not have practice problems, but they might be included in the future!
