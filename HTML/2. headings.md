## Headings

There are 6 types of headings in HTML - `h1` through `h6`

`h1` being the biggest and `h6` being the smallest

Here's a picture of how they would look

The Code:

```html
<h1>This is a heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is a heading 2</h2>
<h3>This is a heading 3</h3>
<h4>This is a heading 4</h4>
<h5>This is a heading 5</h5>
<h6>This is a heading 6</h6>
```

**Important Note: When using headings in a webpage don't use headings based on size, use them based on a hierarchy, so like as subtopics. The size can be changed later with CSS (A styling language).**

## Extra: Paragraphs

Paragraphs are made with the `<p>` tag

Here's a picture of how they would look
