HTML is a markup language that is used to create web pages, so it's not like a programming language.
## HTML Strucutre
HTML is structured by tags and content which make up elements. There are ways of declaring an element.

1. The first way of declaring elements are with an opening tag and a closing tag, the opening tag has a `<` to begin and a `>` to end. The closing tag has a `</` to begin and a `>` to end. Everything else between the opening and closing tags is either content or other nested elements

2. The second way is through self-closing tags, that don't have any content between them and it is structured with a `<` to begin and a `>` to end. They're also called void elements and what that means is that they can't contain any nested Elements, Comments, and any Character data.

## Boilerplate code

Here is the neccesary code to start a webpage

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>

	</head>
	<body>

	</body>
</html>
```

## DOCTYPE decleration

Here is what the Doctype Declaration - `<!DOCTYPE html>` means according to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Doctype)
> In HTML, the doctype is the required "<!DOCTYPE html>" preamble found at the top of all documents. Its sole purpose is to prevent a browser from switching into so-called “quirks mode” when rendering a document; that is, the "<!DOCTYPE html>" doctype ensures that the browser makes a best-effort attempt at following the relevant specifications, rather than using a different rendering mode that is incompatible with some specifications.

## Comments

Comments are blocks of text that are ignored when the browser is trying to render the webpage. There are multiple use cases for comments, such as to make notes for when you come back later so you know what that section of the code is for. Another use case is if someone else is coding with you. Comments are also used for commenting code out which is useful when trying to see why code doesn't work. The syntax goes like
```html
<!--Anything can go here-->
```
