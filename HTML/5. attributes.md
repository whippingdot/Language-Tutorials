# Attributes

Attributes add extra information to elements. There are two main types of attributes.

1.	The first type of attribute contains an attribute value. For example there are the `length` and `width` attributes, they specify the length and width of an element.

	Here's the structure.

	```html
	<!--With an element-->
	<element attributeName="attributeValue">Content</element>
	<!--With a self-closing tag-->
	<element attributeName="attributeValue">
	```
2. The second type of attribute does not contain an attribute 		value and simply just describes it. 
	Here's the structure
	```html
	<!--With an element-->
	<element attributeName>Content</element>
	<!--With a self-closing tag-->
	<element attributeName>
	```

Here are a few tags that use attributes

## Anchor Elements (Links)

Anchor elements or links are introduced with the `<a>...</a>` element, and the attribute that is needed with them is the `href` attribute, and this needs a value. The value is where you want the browser to go when the user clicks on the link.

Here's an example

Code:

```html
<a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>
```

## Image Elements

Images are made with the `<img>` tag. It's a self-closing tag, and the attribute that is need is the `src` tag which needs a value. This value is where the image is located

Here's an example

Code:

```html
<img src="https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/1x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png">
