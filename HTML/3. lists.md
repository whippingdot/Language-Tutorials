## Basics

There are two types of lists, unordered lists and ordered lists. Unordered lists are noted with the `<ul>` element , and ordered list are noted with the `<ol>` element. For each of those elements you need an `<li>` element for each list item inside

## `<ul>`

Here's an example with the `<ul>` element

```html
<ul>
	<li>Eat</li>
	<li>Sleep</li>
	<li>Code</li>
</ul>
```

This would output:

## `<ol>`

Here's an example with an `<ol>`

```html
<ol>
	<li>Eat</li>
	<li>Sleep</li>
	<li>Code</li>
</ol>
```

Output:

![Ordered List Picture](images/ol.png)
