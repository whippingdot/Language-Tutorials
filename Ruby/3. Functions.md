# Intro

Function's are super important in any coding language! Ruby is no exception to this, let's get started with ruby functions!

# Ruby Functions

Ruby functions are very similar to python's functions, you start it with the same keyword! But the only thing you do different, it you don't put a semicolon, just tab and that's it! Here is an example of it!

``` ruby
def sayHello()
	puts "Hello World"
end
```
Let's break what just happend down. 

We define a function using def, this is similar to python, and we define the function name this `()`. You can also put function paramiters in there. Then instead of a **`:`**. We don't put anything there! In fact, we just go to a new line and indent!. Then you can put your function code in there! When we finish our function, we go to a new line, make sure we go to the same indentation as out def statment (so you don't stop the wrong one), and you put an <code class= "ruby"> end </code> statments and we have now made a function! You can call on this function using `sayHello()`! Our function will be exacuted and we will have made a small little function!
