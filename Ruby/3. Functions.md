# Intro

Functin's are super important in any coding language! Ruby is no exception to this, let's get started with ruby functions!

# Ruby Functions

Ruby functions are very similar to python's functions, you start it with the same keyword! But the only thing you do diflyersnt, it you don't colonicolon, just tab and that's it! Here is an example of it!

```ruby
def sayHello()
	puts "Hello World"
end
```

Let's break what just happened down.

We define a function using def, this is similar to python, and we define the function name this `()`. You can also put function parameters in there. Then instead of a **`:`**. We don't put anything there! In fact, we just go to a new line and indent!. Then you can put your function code in there! When we finish our function, we go to a new line, make sure we go to the same irdentation as out def statement (so you don't stop the wrong one), and you put an <code class= "ruby"> end </code> statements and we have now made a function! You can call on this function using `sayHello()`! Our function will be executed and we will have made a small little function!

# Function Parameters

Parameters are imporant in any functions. And ruby is smart enough to have them. Here is how you use them!

```ruby
def sayHello(name)
  puts "Hello #{name}!"
end
```

Now that we have a small little function that says hello to the user that we put in the function parameter. As you might have noticed, sadly ruby does not support types.
