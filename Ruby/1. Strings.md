# Strings in Ruby

While **`ruby`** isn't really meant for text adventures, they can be used for them quite well.

Ruby is like python, reads top to bottom, doesn't require brackets, and is usually easy to look at because of its simple syntax and default organization. So, let's get on with what we wanted to do, learn how ruby strings work!

---

# Printing

Strings in Ruby are very similar to python's strings, they don't require `()` though,(you can still use them like me). Ruby's print function uses the **`puts`** prefix, here is a demonstration of this in code:

```ruby
puts "Hello World"
# Will return the string value, 'Hello World'(without quotes)
```

If you do not want two `puts` statements on the same line, do:

```ruby
print "Hello"
print " world!"
```

You can use ASCII codes for colors and special chars for both of them.

# String Conjunction

To add variables to a string without embedding them is fairly simple and is the same way as you would in python. You would separate them by using a **`+`** symbol.
Here is an example of this:

```ruby
puts "Hello " + "world!"
```

This is will return `Hello World!` as if they were not separated by a `+`!
