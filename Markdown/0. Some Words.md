# A few things

## Start

So, Markdown isn't a coding language like Python or Ruby. It is actually a kind of language which you can use to document things. It is basically a text file with extra functions. Here in this set of files, I am going to teach you how to use Markdown. It is pretty simple, and easy to remember, and it is useful in many areas (including GitHub where you can write comments and other things with it). Markdown is very popular and so I heavily recommend you learn it!

## Running Markdown

You can't run Markdown because it isn't a coding language. Instead, you type it out in a `.md` file and there should be a preview button you can press to see the preview or the editor you are using will be a WYSIWYG editor which means you will get the output while typing the syntax. I recommend VS Code for this as VS Code is actually a very good Markdown editor, but you can also use things like Typora to write Markdown if you want.

### Tip

I created a recommended extensions for VS Code file for this repository. You will get a notification when you enter this repository in VS Code telling you to install them. One is a theme that I absolutely love and the other is an extension which will help you code Markdown. The second one is recommended strongly by me so install it, but the theme is your choice!
