# Headings

## Start

Headings in Markdown (MD) are basically text that gets bigger. Right now, two headings you must have seen are the 'Headings' heading at the start of the page and the 'Start' heading right above this piece of text.

## Creating Them

There are 6 types of headings but in some applications only the first three work. These six are:

- `#` is heading 1, which is the biggest heading and is the first heading on this page.
- `##` is heading 2, which is the second biggest heading and is the second heading on this page.
- `###` is heading 3, which is the third-largest heading and the last heading supported everywhere. It is the heading underneath these bullet points.
- `####` is the third least large heading.
- `#####` is the second least largest heading. It is almost the size of the normal text in a lot of editors.
- `######` is the smallest heading and is smaller than normal text in most editors. The only difference is that it is bold like all the other headings.
