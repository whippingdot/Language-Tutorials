# Images

## Start

Images in markdown are used to display, you guessed it, an image. Images can be displayed for any reason, and so we don't really have anything to state on the front. The format to display an image in markdown is pretty similar to the format to display links - just add an exclamation mark `!` before the square brackets `[]`. This time though, the square brackets are used to have alt(alternative) text, which is basically text that is displayed if you can't see the image for some reason - like some blocker blocking the website link, or an incorrect link. The brackets `()` are used for the same thing as before in links - the link - but of the image.
