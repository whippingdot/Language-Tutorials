# Links

## Start

Links in markdown are used to link to different websites, or, in some markdown apps, are used to link to different parts of the current markdown document. They can also be used to link to different markdown files. The format to create a link is two open square brackets `[]` and two open brackets `()`. Inside the square brackets, the placeholder text is kept, and inside the brackets, the link is kept. The placeholder text is basically the text you see inside of the link.

### Code

```markdown
[Example Website](https://example.com)
```

### Output

[Example Website](https://example.com)

We use links at the end of every markdown file in these tutorials (or in every file @whippingdot makes). The links link to the previous file in the tutorial and the next file in the tutorial. You can see an example of it, in action, here:
