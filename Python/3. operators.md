# Operators

## Start
In this markdown file I am going to teach you about operators. The operators are:
- `+`
- `-`
- `*`
- `/`
- `%`

## What they do
The `+` operator adds things together.
The `-` operator subtracts two things.
The `*` operator multiplies things together.
The `/` operator divides two things.
The `%` operator find the reminder of a division.

### Code
```python
four = 4
three = 3
addition = 3 + 4

print(three + four)
print(three - four)
print(three * four * 2)
print(four / three)
print(three % four)

print(addition)
```

### Output
```shell
7
-1
24
1.333
3
7
```

## PEMDAS
Python follows PEMDAS meaning the Parentheses will happen first, then Multiplication and Division (there is no power unless you import math and use pow()), and then finally Addition and Subtraction.

### Code
```python
print(4 + 3 * (3 + 4) - (3 - 4))
```

### Output
```shell
26
```
