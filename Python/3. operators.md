# Operators

## Start

In this markdown file, I am going to teach you about operators. The operators are:

- `+`
- `-`
- `*`
- `/`
- `%`
- `//`
- `**`

## What they do

The `+` operator adds things together. \
The `-` operator subtracts two things. \
The `*` operator multiplies things together. \
The `/` operator divides two things. \
The `%` operator find the reminder of a division. \
The `//` operator divided two things and returns a flat(whole) number. \
The `**` operator is the exponential operator. The second number is the exponent.

### Code

```python
four = 4
three = 3
addition = 3 + 4

print(three + four)
print(four - three)
print(three * four * 2)
print(four / three)
print(four % three)
print(four // three)
print(four ** three)

print(addition)
```

### Output

```shell
7
1
24
1.333
1
1
64
7
```

## PEMDAS

Python follows PEMDAS meaning the Parentheses will happen first, then the Exponents, then Multiplication and Division, and then finally Addition and Subtraction.

### Code

```python
print(4 + 3 * (3 ** 2 + 4) - (3 - 4))
```

### Output

```shell
44
```
