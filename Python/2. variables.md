# Variables

## Start

In this file, we are going to learn about variables. Variables are names which hold properties, like the name baa holding the property 3. Variables can be of a few types:

- String
- Integer
- Decimal
- Boolean

## Explanation of Variables

A string is a piece of text in double or single quotations: `""` and `''` respectively.
An integer is a number like 1, 2, 23, or 333.
A decimal is a number with decimal points. Examples are 2.3, 44.333, 22.1345, or 25.92.
A boolean is either `True` or `False` with capital Ts and Fs respectively.

There are other things like Dictionaries `{}` or Lists `[]` but instead of containing raw data, they contain other variables.

## Defining a variable

You define a variable by typing the variable's name is equal to the value it holds.

### Code

```python
aString = "Im a string BOI"
aNumber = 33
aDecimal = 44.56
aBool = True
aDict = {"what" : 3, "blah" : "oh no"}
aList = [3, 4, "D", 2.4, True, False, [[3, 4, 5, 6, 7], True]]

print(
  "String:", aString,
  "\nNumber:", aNumber,
  "\nDecimal:", aDecimal,
  "\nBoolean:", aBool,
  "\nDictionary:", aDict,
  "\nList:", aList
)
```

### Output

```shell
String: Im a string BOI
Number: 33
Decimal: 44.56
Boolean: True
Dictionary: {"what" : 3, "blah" : "oh no"}
List: [3, 4, "D", 2.4, True, False, [[3, 4, 5, 6, 7], True]]
```

`\n` means a new line. If you add that in the middle of a print statement in double or single quotes, it will print the rest on a new line. You can also add newlines inside of lists, dictionaries, and tuples `()`. To check the type of a variable, enter `>>> type(aVar)` or `print(type(aVar))`.

_Note: Because the parameters for a function are inside a tuple, you can add newlines like in the code above. This shouldn't affect the actual code execution._
