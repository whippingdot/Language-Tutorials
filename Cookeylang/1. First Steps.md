# First Steps

Now that you have cookeylang up and running, lets start writing some code!
Create a new file called `main.clf`. Add this:

```clf
printLine("Hello, CookeyLang!");
```

## Breakdown

The program is calling a _function_. This function is called `printLine` which prints to the console terminal with a _string_, namely `Hell, CookeyLang!`.
Another common function is `print` which is like `printLine` but there is no newline at the end.
